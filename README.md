# Heart-Failure-detection-ML
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to Predict heart diseases.
And aiming to enhance research and prevention efforts by analyzing a heart disease patient dataset and employing various algorithms.

Using algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression, accurate predictions can be made. 

Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied in Python, treating the problem as a binary classification task to determine the presence of heart disease based on various parameters. 

Achieving an accuracy of 95% with the Random Forest algorithm, the dataset used for training and testing can be accessed at:
